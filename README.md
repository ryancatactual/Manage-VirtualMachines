# Manage-VirtualMachines

This was created for a specific environment with specific needs. Realize it is 100% not perfect and a side project I worked on. This was the product of losing the original script I had written, which was much worse than this, and trying to port it to being an actual PowerShell module.

It isn't finished and a lot of the functionality is not coded yet, but the structure for everything is there and can easily be modified to suit whatever needs you may have.

I do not have a list of references I used to make this, but I appreciate all the random internet help I got to build this tool. Feel free to email me if you have questions: ryancatactual at gmail dot com
